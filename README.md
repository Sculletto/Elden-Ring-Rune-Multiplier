Elden Ring – Rune Reward Multiplier (Smithbox)

This script allows anyone to modify rune rewards for all enemies in Elden Ring by applying a multiplier to existing values. It is built specifically to work with Smithbox and its CSV export/import features.
IMPORTANT: - Always back up your save files and regulation.bin before making changes. - I am not responsible for corrupted files. - This script ONLY edits rune reward values using a multiplier and does not modify any other data. - Because it relies on Smithbox exports, this should continue working through updates as long as Smithbox itself is updated.
REQUIREMENTS
•	Python
•	One dependency: python -m pip install tkinterdnd2
HOW RUNE REWARDS WORK
Rune rewards are defined in two parameter tables: - GameAreaParam - NpcParam
Both must be edited to fully change rune gain for all enemies.
SETUP
1.	Create a folder anywhere to run the Python script from.
2.	The script will export the modified CSV file into the same directory it is run from.
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
EXPORT PARAMETERS FROM SMITHBOX
1.	Launch Smithbox and open the Parameter Editor.
2.	In the left panel, select GameAreaParam.
3.	With it highlighted, go to: Data > Export > All Rows > Export To File > Export All Fields
4.	Name the file whatever you want and remember where it is saved.
RUN THE SCRIPT
5.	Run the Python script.
6.	Enter the rune multiplier when prompted.
–	Minimum: 0.01
–	Maximum: 10
–	You can edit the script to go higher if you want.
7.	Drag the exported CSV file onto the script window.
8.	The script will apply the multiplier, export a new CSV to the script’s directory, and display how many cells were modified as confirmation.
IMPORT THE MODIFIED CSV
9.	In Smithbox, make sure the same parameter is selected (GameAreaParam or NpcParam).
10.	Import the edited CSV: Data > Import CSV > From File… > All Fields
11.	Select the CSV generated by the script (filename ends in soulx#).
12.	Rows turning green indicates the changes were applied successfully.
REPEAT FOR NPCPARAM
13.	Repeat steps 2–12 using NpcParam.
FINAL STEP
Save your Smithbox project and use the updated regulation.bin located in the project folder.
